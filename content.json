Spark uses random access memory (RAM) to cache and process data instead of a file system. Spark creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to schedule tasks and the orchestration of nodes across the Hadoop cluster. How Spark work in cluster?HDFS,Yarn,Spark HDFS: Name node, Data Node Yarn: Resource Manager, Node Manager Spark: Driver, Worker when spark start to work, it need HDFS to provide the data and Yarn to provide computing resource.
